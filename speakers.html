											<strong>Abstract: </strong>
											The rampage of incessant cyber attacks have caused the disclosure of billions of users’ private data, shaking the Internet to its core. In response, various data privacy laws and regulations have emerged, forcing the industry to change their practice and bringing the demand for large-scale secure computing to the spotlight. Such a demand, however, cannot be met by the state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques, even with decades of effort, due to the overheads (speed, bandwidth consumption) they incur. To narrow the gap, recent years have seen rapid progress in hardware based trusted execution environments (TEE), such as Intel SGX, AMD SEV and ARM TrustZone, which enable efficient computation on encrypted data within a secure enclave established by a trusted processor.  In this talk, I will present our research on understanding and addressing the security challenges in this new secure computing paradigm and enhancing its design to achieve scalability, for the purpose of supporting accelerated machine learning.  Further I will present the big questions that need to be answered in the area and introduce our genome privacy competition as a synergic activity that helps move the science in this area forward.

											<strong>Abstract: </strong>
											Touchscreen-based electronic devices such as smart phones and smart tablets are widely used in our daily life. While the security of electronic devices have been heavily investigated recently, the resilience of touchscreens against various attacks has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this talk, I will show that touchscreen-based electronic devices are vulnerable to intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) attacks in a systematic way and how to conduct this attack in a practical way. I will show how to calculate both the minimum amount of electric field and signal frequency required to induce touchscreen ghost touches. I will further analyze our IEMI attack on real touchscreens with different magnitudes, frequencies, duration, and multitouch patterns. This new attack works directly on the touchscreen circuit regardless of the touchscreen scanning mechanism or operating system. I will conclude the talk with potential solutions for touchscreen protection against IEMI, or similar, attacks.

											<strong>Abstract: </strong>
											Conceptualized 12 years ago as a core component of Bitcoin, blockchain has gained a vast amount of interest. Informally speaking, a blockchain is a distributed, shared, and immutable ledger that maintains a growing list of ordered records. It became extremely popular among the industries in the last few years. Many companies are exploring applications of blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies. 
											In this talk, the speaker will introduce blockchain and highlight some of the latest development in this area. In particular, we will discuss the role of cryptography in blockchains, and why it is crucial. We will also discuss attacks that may circumvent present cryptographic protection mechanisms. Topics covered include threshold cryptosystems, anonymous credentials, ring signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, and post-quantum cryptography. Finally, we will conclude the talk with challenges related to the adoption of blockchain technologies and insights developed from our experience. <p></p>

											<strong>Abstract: </strong>
											It is well known private information in Android apps can be directly obtained by abusing the Intent mechanism and be inferred by analyzing their network traffic. In this talk, we will report two new observations. First,  we uncover that there is a previously unknown attack surface in Android framework that can be exploited by unauthorized apps to violate the access control. Second, we found that it is possible to identify method-level fine-grained user action of Android apps by combining the analysis of apps and their network traffic.

													<strong>Abstract: </strong>
													Similarity queries, giving a way to disease diagnosis based on similar patients, have wide applications in eHealthcare and are essentially demanded to be processed under fine-grained access policies due to the high sensitivity of healthcare data. One efficient and flexible way to implement such queries is to outsource healthcare data and the corresponding query services to a powerful cloud. Nevertheless, considering data privacy, healthcare data are usually outsourced in an encrypted form and required to be accessed in a privacy-preserving way. In the past years, many schemes have been proposed for privacy-preserving similarity queries. However, none of them is applicable to achieve data access control and access pattern privacy preservation. Aiming at this challenge, we propose an efficient and access pattern privacy-preserving similarity range query scheme with access control (named EPSim-AC).

													Heterogeneous-PAKE: Bridging the Gap between PAKE Protocols and Their Real-World Deployment
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td colspan="2" class="_abstract">
													<strong>Abstract: </strong>
													PAKE protocol has been considered a suitable substitute for the prevailing hash-based authentication which is vulnerable to various attacks. However, vendors are discouraged by both its prohibitively computational overheads as well as integrating costs, leading to its limited use since being proposed. In this talk, I will present Heterogeneous-PAKE, an entire PAKE stack with high-performance and compatibility for both client-side and server-side for Web systems. Heterogeneous-PAKE harvests high throughput on the server-side which supports over 1,650k concurrent user per second. Meanwhile, on most testing platforms, the latency is well controlled within user-acceptable bounds, which is less than 3x that of a traditional authentication approach based on Bcrypt. The empirical results demonstrate that the Heterogeneous-PAKE is a very economical (with only a GPU-ready server) and convenient (with an easy-to-integrate software stack without user participation or database rebuilding) solution for upgrading existing systems with high-performance PAKE services.<p></p>
